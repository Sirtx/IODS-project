```{r child = "chapter1.Rmd"}
# This will include Chapter 1 (that is updated in its own file) in the document.
```

***

```{r child = "chapter2.Rmd"}
# This will include Chapter 2 (that is updated in its own file) in the document.
```

***

```{r child = "chapter3.Rmd"}
# This will include Chapter 3 (that is updated in its own file) in the document.
```

***

<!-- ```{r child = "chapter4.Rmd"} -->
<!-- # This will include Chapter 4 (that is updated in its own file) in the document. -->
<!-- ``` -->

***
```{r child = "chapter5.Rmd"}
# This will include Chapter 4 (that is updated in its own file) in the document.
