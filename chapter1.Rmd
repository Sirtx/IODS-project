# Open Data Science course 

I heard about this course from PhD School's mailing list, and  other PhD students in our group had taken the course couple years ago, and found it useful. I'm using **R** and **RStudio** regularly during my work, but I've used __git/github__ very little, and never used __RMarkdown__ before, so I hope the course will improve my skills and routines for:  

* code documentation  
* visualization  
* version control
